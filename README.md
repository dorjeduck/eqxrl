# EqxRL - JAX/Equinox Reinforcement Learning Projects

⚠️ Work In Progress ⚠️

This repository contains implementations of various reinforcement learning algorithms ported to JAX and Equinox. The main goal is to learn and understand both RL concepts and JAX/Equinox frameworks through hands-on implementation. 


> **Note**: While most JAX-based RL implementations use Flax/Linen for neural network components, this project specifically explores using Equinox as an alternative. This is mainly for learning purposes and to understand the differences between these approaches.

## Overview
This project focuses on reimplementing classic RL algorithms using JAX's functional programming paradigm and Equinox's neural network utilities. By porting existing implementations to JAX/Equinox, we can leverage:

* JAX's automatic differentiation
* Hardware acceleration (GPU/TPU support)
* Just-in-time compilation
* Functional transformations (vmap, pmap)

## Current Status
This is an active work in progress. Expect frequent changes, refactoring, and potential breaking changes. Some implementations may be incomplete or unoptimized.


## Notes
This is a personal learning project. Implementations may not be production-ready and are primarily focused on understanding RL concepts and JAX/Equinox programming patterns.
